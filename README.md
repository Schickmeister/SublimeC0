Installation
============
There are 2 ways to install the C0 package. The 2 ways are:

### Using [Package Control] (http://sublime.wbond.net): ###

Make sure you have Sublime Text 2/3 installed and follow the steps below:

1. Install Package Control, follow instructions [here] (http://sublime.wbond.net/installation)
2. Press on **Tools > Command Palette** and search for **Install Package** then press **Enter**
3. Search for **C0**, you should find the package, then click **Enter** to install

You have installed the package, enjoy! 

### Clone the SublimeC0 Repository: ###

This way would require more work than using the Package Control but will be convenient for getting the latest updates. In this way, you need to clone the SublimeC0 repo directly to your "Sublime Packages". This would allow you to get the latest updates when you just call `git pull`

**If you ever find issues with the package, please make sure to report. This package is new and issues are expected.**
